<h2>Capture Samples</h2>
<h3><a name="glut_capture">Capture and GLUT</a></h3>

  <p>This application uses GLUT and OpenGL to create a window with a canvas and 
  draw the image into that canvas. But the image is obtained from a capture 
  device. The image can be processed before display and a sequence of captured 
  images can be saved in an AVI file during capture.</p>
  <p>You can view the source code here: <a href="../examples/glut_capture.c">glut_capture.c</a></p>

<h3><a name="iupglcap">Capture and IUP</a></h3>

  <p>This application uses IUP and OpenGL to create a window with two canvases 
  and draw a video capture image into one canvas. A processed image can be 
  displayed in the second canvas. It can also process frames from a video file.</p>
  <p>You can download the source code and some compiler projects here:
