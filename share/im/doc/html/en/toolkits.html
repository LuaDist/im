<h2>Comparing IM with Other Imaging Toolkits</h2>

  <p>Still today there is a need for something easier to code and understand in 
  Imaging. The available free libraries are sometimes close, sometimes very far 
  from &#8220;easier&#8221;. IM is an unexplored solution and proposed as a simple and clean 
  one. It is another Imaging tool with a different approach to the many 
  possibilities in the area. Its organization was designed so it can be used for 
  teaching Imaging concepts. We invite you to try it.</p>
  <p>First we list some libraries mainly target for storage, then some 
  scientific libraries, and then a small comparsion of IM and those libraries.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Here are some free storage libraries:</p>
  <p><b>Imlib2</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2003-09 / Version 1.1.0<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/imlib2.html">
    http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/imlib2.html</a> <br>
    Language C<br>
    Documentation is terrible. Depends on the X-Windows System libraries.<br>
    It is designed for display/rendering performance.</p>
  
  <p><b>Corona</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2003-09 / Version 1.0.2<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://corona.sourceforge.net/">
    http://corona.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
    Language C++<br>
    Very simple library. Only a few formats. Only bitmap images, no video. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><b>PaintLib</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2004-04 / Version 2.61<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/">
    http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/</a><br>
    Language C++<br>
    A very simple library.<br>
    Has an interesting ActiveX component. Only bitmap images, no video.</p>
  
  <p><b>NetPBM</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2004-07 / Version 10.23<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">
    http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/</a> <br>
    Language C<br>
    A traditional library that starts at the Pbmplus package more than 10 years 
    ago.<br>
    Very stable, it has support for the PNM format family and many processing 
    operations. <br>
    &nbsp;Only bitmap images, no video.</p>
  
  <p><b>DevIL ***</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2004-06 / Version 1.6.7 <br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://openil.sourceforge.net/">
    http://openil.sourceforge.net/</a> <br>
    Language C (Has also a C++ Wrapper)<br>
    Called initially OpenIL. Supports many formats and have a very interesting 
    API, that works very similar the OpenGL API (that's why the original name). 
    Also supports the display in several graphics systems. Has several data 
    types as OpenGL has.</p>
  
  <p><b>FreeImage ***</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2004-07 / Version 3.4.0<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/">
    http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/</a> <br>
    Language C (Has also a C++ Wrapper)<br>
    Supports many formats. Many data types, but only RGB and subclasses (gray, 
    map, etc).<br>
    Very well written, stable and simple to use.</p>
  
  <p><b>ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick ***</b></p>
  
    <p class="info">Last Update 2004-07 / Version 6.0.3 || Last Update 2004-04 / Version 
    1.0.6<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">
    http://www.imagemagick.org/</a> ||
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/">
    http://www.graphicsmagick.org/</a><br>
    Language C (Has also a C++ Wrapper)<br>
    The two libraries are listed together because GraphicsMagick is totally and 
    explicitly based on ImageMagick version 5.5.2.<br>
    They have very similar or identical APIs but the development process is 
    completely different. GraphicsMagick propose a more organized development 
    process (a more precise comparison requires detailed knowledge about the two 
    libraries).<br>
    These are very complete libraries. They support lots of file formats, 
    several color spaces, but use only the byte data type.<br>
    They use a big image structure with everything inside. Image creation may 
    involve about 40 parameters.</p>

    color spaces. Support for input and output of image sequences. Support for 
    generic image attributes (metadata), which includes several standard TIFF 
    tags, GeoTIFF tags and Exif tags. Image storage and capture data can be 
    accessed using an image structure or with raw data. Internal implementation 
    in C++ but with a simple C API. Code is portable for Windows and UNIX. Many 
    image processing operations.</p>

  <h3>Comparsion</h3>
  <p>The idea behind IM was to create a toolkit that was not so complex as 
  OpenCV, neither so big as VTK, but that can be used as a solid base to the 
  development of thesis and dissertations, as for commercial applications. </p>
  <p>As the academic environment is very heterogeneous the IM project choose 
  some directives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Portability (Windows and UNIX)</li>
    <li>C API</li>
    <li>Totally Free, Open Source</li>
    <li>Focus in Scientific Applications</li>
    <li>Easy to Learn</li>
    <li>Easy to Reuse</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Considering these directives there are only a few similar toolkits. Making 
  some exceptions the following should be mentioned: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>JAI - Java, Sun.com</li>
    <li>VIGRA - C++ / STL Based, University</li>
    <li>VIPS - Large Images / Macros, University</li>
    <li>VTK - C++ / Huge / Visualization, Kitware.com</li>
    <li>OpenCV &#8211; &#8220;best&#8221; similar choice, Intel.com </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Today OpenCV and VTK are the most professional and complete choices of free 
  libraries that are similar to IM. But they are more complicated than IM. For 
  instance VTK it is very large, it has about 700 C++ classes. </p>
  <p>Although OpenCV has many resources, its code is very hard to reuse. The 
  simplicity of the IM code, mainly the image processing routines, make it a 
  good reference to be reused by other applications extracting only the code 
  needed with little changes. And can be used as an complement to learn image 
  processing algorithms and techniques.</p>
