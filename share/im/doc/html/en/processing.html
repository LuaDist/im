<h1>Image Processing</h1>

  <p>We use the simpliest model possible, a function with input data, output 
  data and control parameters. </p>
  <p>The operations have usually one or more input images, and one or more 
  output images.&nbsp; We avoid implementing in-place operations, but many 
  operations can use the same data for input and output. The data type, color 
  mode and size of the images depends on the operation. Sometimes the operations 
  can change the data type to increase the precision of the results, but 
  normally only a few operations will change the size (resize and geometric) and 
  color mode (color conversion). All of these details are described in each 
  function documentation, check before using them.</p>
  <p>There is no ROI (Region Of Interest) management, but you can <strong>
  imProcessCrop</strong>, <strong>imProcess</strong>*, 
  then <strong>imProcessInsert</strong> the result in the original image.</p>
<p>The image data of the output image is assumed to be zero before any 
operation. This is always true after creating a new image, but if you are 
reusing an image for several operation use <strong>imImageClear</strong> to zero 
the image data between operations.</p>
