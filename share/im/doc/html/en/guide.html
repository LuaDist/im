<h1>Guide</h1>
<h3><a name="startup">Getting Started</a></h3>

  <p>It is important to understand that IM is based in 4 concepts: <b>Image Representation</b>, <b>Image Storage</b>, <b>
  Image Processing</b> and <b>Image Capture</b>. The following picture illustrates the relation between theses concepts.</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="imaging.gif" width="704" height="346"></p>
  <p>IM does not have support for <b>Image Visualization</b>, because we think this is a task for a graphics library 
  like OpenGL, Windows GDI or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd/">CD 
  - Canvas Draw</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Image Representation</b> describes the image model and its details. Which color systems are going to be used, 
  which data types, how the data is organized in memory, and how other image characteristics are accessed.</p>
  <p><b>Image Storage</b> describers the file format model and how images are obtained or saved. <b>Image Capture</b> 
  describes the access to a capture device and obtaining an image from it. <b>Image Processing</b> describes the image 
  processing operations.</p>
  <p>There are infinite ways to implement these concepts. There is no common definition in the literature, but there is 
  a standard called Programmer's Imaging Kernel System (PIKS) published at the ISO/IEC 12087. PIKS is a very complete 
  and also complex standard, very hard to implement. There are only a few implementations available, and the one that I 
  know is commercial software, Pixel Soft of William Pratt <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pixelsoft.com/">
  http://www.pixelsoft.com/</a>, also author of several books on the subject.</p>
  <p>But we want something easier to implement and understand. The free available libraries that we found where 
  sometimes close to what we want, sometimes very far. So we developed our own. </p>
  <p>The documentation contains <b>Overview, Guide, Samples</b> and <b>Reference</b> sections for each one of the IM 
  concepts. </p>
  <p>The <b>Guide</b> is where you are going to find the explanation about the concepts and decisions made during the 
  library design. It is the best place to understand how things works. </p>
  <p>The <b>Reference</b> contains pure essential information for function and structure usage. But there is no 
  information on how to put the functions to work together. It is generated automatically from the source code using 
  Doxygen, this means also that the include files (*.h) are very well commented.</p>

<h3><a name="buildapp">Building Applications</a></h3>

  <p>Inside you code you should at least include the &lt;im.h&gt; header and link with the &quot;im.lib/libim.a/libim.so&quot; library. 
  This library contains all the <b>Image Representation</b> functions and all the <b>Image Storage</b> functions (with 
  the exception of the external formats: AVI, JP2 and WMV).</p>
  <p>Each external format or processing usually needs a &lt;im_xx.h&gt; file and a &quot;im_xx.lib/libim_xx.a/libim_xx.so&quot; file.</p>
  <p>Even if your application is only in C, you must link with a C++ capable linker. Using Tecmake set &quot;LINKER := g++&quot; 
  in your &quot;config.mak&quot; when compiling with gcc (UNIX and Windows).</p>
  <p>The download files list includes the <a href="download_tips.html">Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Library Download Tips</a> 
  document, with a description of all the available binaries.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="buildlib">Building the Library</a> </h3>

<p>In the Downloads you will be able to find pre-compiled binaries for many 
platforms, all those binaries were built using Tecmake. Tecmake is a command line multi compiler build tool 
based on GNU make, available at
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake</a>. Tecmake is 
  used by all the Tecgraf libraries and many applications.</p>
<p>You do not need to install Tecmake, scripts for Posix and Windows systems are already included in the source code package. Just type &quot;make&quot; 
in the command line on the main folder and all libraries and executables will be 
build.</p>
<p>In Linux, check the &quot;<a href="building.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Linux</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>In Windows, check the &quot;<a href="buildwin.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Window</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>If you decide to install Tecmake, the Tecmake configuration 
files (*.mak) are available at the &quot;src&quot; folder, and are very easy to understand. 
In the<b> </b>main folder, and in each source folder, there are files 
named 
<i>make_uname.bat</i> that build the libraries using <b>Tecmake</b>. To build 
for Windows using Visual C 9.0 (2008) for example, just execute <i>&quot;make_uname 
vc9&quot;</i> in the iup main folder, or for the DLLs type <i>
&quot;make_uname dll9&quot;</i>. The Visual Studio workspaces with the respective projects 
available in the source package is for debugging purposes only.</p>
<p>Make sure you have all the dependencies for the library you want installed, 
see the documentation bellow.</p>
<p>If you are going to build all the libraries, 
the makefiles and projects expect the following directory tree:</p>
<pre>\mylibs\
        im\
        lua5.1\</pre>
<p>To control that location set the TECTOOLS_HOME environment variable to the 
folder were the Lua libraries are installed.</p>
<h4>Libraries Dependencies</h4>

<p>As a general rule (excluding system dependencies and included third party 
libraries): IM has NO external dependencies, and IMLua depends on Lua.</p>
<p>The Lua bindings for IUP, CD and IM (Makefiles and Pre-compiled binaries) 
depend on the <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">LuaBinaries</a> 
distribution. So if you are going to build from source, then use the <strong>LuaBinaries</strong> 
source package also, not the <strong>Lua.org</strong> original source package. 
If you like to use another location for the Lua files define LUA_SUFFIX, LUA_INC, 
LUA_LIB and LUA_BIN before using Tecmake.</p>

<h3><a name="CD">CD Compatibility</a></h3>

  <p>IM version 2 was designed to perfectly work with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd/">CD 
  - Canvas Draw</a> toolkit. Version 3 has many more options and only for a subset of the images called Bitmaps can be 
  used with the CD functions. Theses images have data type <b>IM_BYTE</b>, and color mode 
  <b>IM_RGB, IM_GRAY, 
  IM_MAP</b> or <b>IM_BINARY</b>. They can not have the flags <b>IM_TOPDOWN</b> and 
  <b>IM_PACKED</b>. 
  But it can have the flag <b>IM_ALPHA</b> for <b>IM_RGB</b> images.</p>
  <p>You can convert an image to a bitmap version of it using the function <b>imConvertToBitmap</b>, see
  <a href="doxygen/group__convert.html">Image Representation / Conversion</a>.</p>
  <p>Function <strong>cdCanvasGetImageRGB</strong> captures an image from the active canvas. Functions 
	<strong>cdCanvasPutImageRect*</strong> draw a client image on the active canvas. These 
  functions allow reducing or increasing the image when drawing.</p>
  <p align="left">For applications in systems with only 256 colors available, we recommend the use of function <strong>
  cdCanvasPalette</strong> before drawing the image, to improve its quality.</p>
  <p align="left">When using the imImage structure the macro <strong>
	imcdCanvasPutImage</strong> can be used. It is defined as:</p>
  <div align="left">
    
      <pre>#define imcdCanvasPutImage(_canvas, _image, _x, _y, _w, _h, _xmin, _xmax, _ymin, _ymax)     \
  {                                                                         \
    if (_image-&gt;color_space == IM_RGB)                                      \
    {                                                                       \
      if (image-&gt;has_alpha)                                                 \
        cdCanvasPutImageRectRGBA(_canvas, _image-&gt;width, _image-&gt;height,    \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[0],                  \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[1],                  \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[2],                  \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[3],                  \
                          _x, _y, _w, _h, _xmin, _xmax, _ymin, _ymax);      \
      else                                                                  \
        cdCanvasPutImageRectRGB(_canvas, _image-&gt;width, _image-&gt;height,     \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[0],                  \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[1],                  \
                          (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[2],                  \
                          _x, _y, _w, _h, _xmin, _xmax, _ymin, _ymax);      \
    }                                                                       \
    else                                                                    \
      cdCanvasPutImageRectMap(_canvas, _image-&gt;width, _image-&gt;height,       \
                        (unsigned char*)_image-&gt;data[0], _image-&gt;palette,   \
                        _x, _y, _w, _h, _xmin, _xmax, _ymin, _ymax);        \

<h3><a name="opengl">OpenGL Compatibility</a></h3>

  <p>The function <b>glDrawPixels</b> accepts several data types and color modes. Here are the <b>format</b> and
  <b>type</b> mapping for OpenGL usage:</p>
  
    <pre>           <b>IM</b>             &lt;-&gt;  <b>OpenGL</b></pre>
    <pre>        <b>color_mode             format</b>
IM_RGB|IM_ALPHA|IM_PACKED  = GL_RGBA               
IM_RGB|IM_PACKED           = GL_RGB
IM_GRAY                    = GL_LUMINANCE
IM_GRAY|IM_ALPHA|IM_PACKED = GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA</pre>
    <pre>        <b>data_type              type</b>
IM_BYTE                    = GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
IM_BINARY                  = GL_BITMAP
IM_USHORT                  = GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT
IM_INT                     = GL_INT
IM_FLOAT                   = GL_FLOAT</pre>
  
  <p>There is no mapping for non <b>IM_PACKED</b> images so if you use unpacked planes (ex: you use the 
  <b>imImage</b> structure) then you have to convert one data into another, the function 
  <b>imConvertPacking</b> 
  does this, so you just have to keep an extra buffer for the display image and call this function only when your 
  original image has changed. See <a href="doxygen/group__convert.html">Image 
  Representation / Conversion</a>. For example:</p>
  
    <pre>imConvertPacking(image-&gt;data[0], gl_data, image-&gt;width, image-&gt;height, image-&gt;depth, image-&gt;data_type, 0);
glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1); /* data alignment must be 1 */

glDrawPixels(image-&gt;width, image-&gt;height, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl_data);</pre>
  
  <p>When loading color image data you can use the function imConvertMapToRGB to convert in-place IM_MAP image data into 
  IM_RGB after loading it from file. For example:</p>
  
    <pre>if (imColorSpace(color_mode) == IM_MAP)
{
  long palette[256];
  int palette_count, packed = 1; /* OpenGL uses packed RGB */
  imFileGetPalette(ifile, palette, &amp;palette_count);
  imConvertMapToRGB(gl_data, width*height, depth, packed, palette, palette_count);
}</pre>
  
  <p>If you are using the <strong>imImage</strong> structure then you can 
	instead use the function <strong>imImageGetOpenGLData</strong>.</p>
<p>If you just want to save your OpenGL buffer then you can use:</p>
  
    <pre>glPixelStorei(GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT, 1); /* data alignment must be 1 */
glReadPixels(x, y, width, height, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl_data);

ifile = imFileNew(filename, format, &amp;error);
error = imFileWriteImageInfo(ifile, width, height, IM_RGB|IM_PACKED, IM_BYTE);
error = imFileWriteImageData(ifile, gl_data);
imFileClose(ifile); </pre>
  
  <p>And when using the <strong>imImage</strong> structure then you can 
	instead use the function <strong>imImageCreateFromOpenGLData</strong>. For 
	instance:</p>
  
    <pre>glPixelStorei(GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT, 1); /* data alignment must be 1 */
glReadPixels(x, y, width, height, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl_data);

imImage* image = imImageCreateFromOpenGLData(width, height, GL_RGB, gl_data); 
error = imFileImageSave(filename, format, image);</pre>
  
  <p>You can also do this 
  inside a loop to create an animation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="compat">IM 2.x Compatibility</a></h3>

  <p>In version 3.0 the library was completely rewritten. And we changed the main API to allow more powerful features. 
  But the old API is still available for backward compatibility. Version 3 is also binary compatible with version 2. </p>
  <p>The only change that must be updated in old applications if they where recompiled is some error code definitions. 
  If you use them in a case there will cause a compiler error because <b>IM_ERR_READ</b> and 
  <b>IM_ERR_WRITE</b> 
  are now defined as <b>IM_ERR_ACCESS</b> both.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="migra">Migrating OLD Code</a> </h3>

  <p>The old API is very inefficient because the file is opened and close three times, for: 
  <b>imFileInfo</b>,
  <b>imImageInfo</b> and <b>imLoadRGB</b>/<b>imLoadMap</b>. There is no room for attributes, so we use 
  the callbacks. And we can not load sequences of images. For these reasons we change the API. </p>
  <p>If you would like to migrate your code using the old API the most important thing to change is the memory 
  allocation. For RGB images instead of allocating 3 separate pointers you should allocate only one pointer with room 
  for all three planes. If you still want to keep the three pointers, just do <b>green = red + width*height</b> 
  and <b>blue = red + 2*width*height</b>.</p>
  <p>Also you should change your callbacks usage for attributes access using <b>imFileGetAttribute</b> and 
  <b>imFileSetAttribute</b>. <b>IM_RESOLUTION_CB</b> is replaced by the attributes &quot;<b>XResolution</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>YResolution</b>&quot;, 
  &quot;<b>ResolutionUnit</b>&quot;. <b>IM_GIF_TRANSPARENT_COLOR_CB</b> is replaced by &quot;<b>TransparencyIndex</b>&quot; 
  and <b>IM_TIF_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_CB</b> by &quot;<b>Description</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p>Except <b>IM_COUNTER_CB</b> that is not an attribute, still works with a callback, but now we implement a 
  counter system for all the library including loading, saving and processing. The user just use the 
  <b>imCounterSetCallback</b> (like before) to register it counter callback, now there are a few more parameters and a 
  user data pointer. See <a href="doxygen/group__counter.html">Utilities / Counter</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The function calls to <b>imImageInfo</b> and <b>imLoadRGB</b>/<b>imLoadMap</b> will be replaced 
  by a sequence of function calls to <b>imFileOpen</b>/<b>imFileNew</b>,&nbsp; 
  <b>imFileReadImageInfo</b>/<b>imFileWriteImageInfo</b>,
  <b>imFileReadImageData</b>/<b>imFileWriteImageData</b> and <b>imFileClose</b>. See
  <a href="doxygen/group__file.html">Image Storage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="names">Names Convention</a></h3>

  <p>To improve the readability of the code we use a very simple naming convention:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Global Functions and Types - &quot;im[Object][Action]&quot; using first capitals (imFileOpen)</li>
    <li>Local Functions and Types - &quot;i[Object][Action]&quot; using first capitals (iTIFFGetCompIndex)</li>
    <li>Local Static Variables - same as local functions and types (iFormatCount)</li>
    <li>Local Static Tables - same as local functions and types with &quot;Table&quot; suffix (iTIFFCompTable)</li>
    <li>Variables and Members - no prefix, all lower case (width)</li>
    <li>Defines and Enumerations - all capitals (IM_ERR_NONE) </li>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="cpp">C x C++ Usage</a></h3>

  <p>The library main API is in C. We adopt this because of the many C programmers out there. Some of the API is also 
  available in C++ for those addicted to classes.</p>
  <p>Internally C++ is used to implement the format driver base architecture. A virtual base class that every drivers 
  inherits from. This made a lot of things easier to the driver development. But we keep it simple, no multiple 
  inheritance, no exception handling, no complicated classes.</p>
  <p>But because we need several data types C++ templates were inevitable used (since we do not like long macros 
  everywhere). But they are used only for processing functions, not classes.</p>
