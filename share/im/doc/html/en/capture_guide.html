<h2>Capture Guide</h2>
<h3><a name="Using">Using</a></h3>

  <p>You can list the installed capture devices using: </p>
  
    <pre>int imVideoCaptureDeviceCount(void)
const char* imVideoCaptureDeviceDesc(int device)</pre>
  
  <p>If a device was removed or added in run time, you must update the list 
  calling:</p>
  
    <pre>int imVideoCaptureReloadDevices(void)</pre>
  
  <p>To handle devices you must create a <b>imVideoCapture</b> structure 
  using the function <b>imVideoCaptureCreate</b>. With this handle you can 
  manage any of the available devices, but only one device. The handle must be 
  destroyed with <b>imVideoCaptureDestroy</b>.</p>
  <p>If you want to access two or more devices at the same time you must create 
  two different structures, but be aware that this usually work for high quality 
  devices like Firewire and USB 2.0. Webcams that use USB1.x can be used if 
  connected to different USB 2.0 controllers.</p>
  <p>The next thing is to connect to a specific device, because all the other 
  remaining functions depends on this connection. Just call <b>imVideoCaptureConnect</b> with one of the available capture device numbers.</p>
  <p>You control when a device start processing frames using <b>imVideoCaptureLive</b>. Once live the frames can be captured using 
  <b>imVideoCaptureFrame</b>. Or you can use <b>imVideoCaptureOneFrame</b>, 
  it will start capturing, returns the captured frame and stop capturing.</p>
  <p>But before capturing a frame you may want to configure the device. You can 
  do it using Attributes, or at least in Windows you can do it using the 
  configuration dialogs with a call to <b>imVideoCaptureShowDialog</b>.</p>
  <p>A very simple sequence of operations to capture just one frame from the 
  first device available:</p>
  
    <pre>imVideoCapture* vc = imVideoCaptureCreate(); 
if (!imVideoCaptureConnect(vc, 0))
  return;

int width, height;
imVideoCaptureGetImageSize(vc, &amp;width, &amp;height);

// initializes the data pointer
void* data = malloc(width*height*3);

imVideoCaptureOneFrame(vc, data, IM_RGB);
imVideoCaptureDestroy(vc);</pre>
  
  <p>The capture library is completely independent from the other libraries. It 
  just uses the same description of the data buffer used in <b>imFileReadImageData</b>.</p>

<h3><a name="Building">Building</a></h3>

  <p>You should include the &lt;im_capture.h&gt; header and link with the 
  &quot;im_capture.lib&quot; library. This library is independent of all IM libraries.&nbsp; 
	In Lua call require&quot;imlua_capture&quot;.</p>
  <p>To link with the capture library in Windows using Visual C you will need 
  the file &quot;<a href="../download/strmiids.zip">strmiids.lib</a>&quot;. To link it 
  using Dev-C++ or Mingw 3 you will need the &quot;<b>im_capture.dll</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p>To compile the capture source code you will need the Direct X 9 SDK. Notice 
  that since Direct X uses COM, CoInitialize(NULL) is called when the devices 
  are enumerated.</p>
  <p>For more information on Direct X capture, i.e. Direct Show see:</p>
