<h1>Image Capture</h1>

  <p>The capture support is designed for live video, it is not for passive 
  digital cameras that only transfer the already taken pictures. Are valid: USB 
  cameras (like most Webcams), Firewire (IEEE 1394) cameras, and analog video 
  capture boards, including TV Tuners. These are called devices.</p>
  <p>The capture functions allows you to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>list the available devices</li>
    <li>connect to a device</li>
    <li>configure the device</li>
    <li>retrieve an image</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can list the installed devices and once you connect to a specific 
  device you can control its parameters. Each connected device captures data 
  frames continuously when in Live state otherwise it stays in standby. You can 
  connect to more than one device at the same time. </p>
  <p>Once connected the user can retrieve frames from the device any time. This 
  can be done with one function call, or inside a closed loop for several 
  frames, or inside an idle function to periodically update the screen. The user 
  is not notified when a new frame is available, but every time the user 
  retrieve a frame, if successful, it is a new frame, old frames are discarded 
  when a new frame arrives.</p>
  <p>Currently it is implemented only in Microsoft Windows. </p>
